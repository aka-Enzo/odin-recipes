    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>At its core, the Sloppy Joe consists of three basic elements — <b>ground beef</b>, tossed with a sweet, tomato-rich <b>sauce</b> (made with ketchup, chili sauce, or actual tomato sauce), and piled on a squishy white <b>bun</b>.</p>
    <p>Some attribute the original Sloppy Joe to a cafe in Sioux City, Iowa, where, many years ago, in 1930 a cook named Joe added tomato sauce to his “loose meat” sandwiches. Voila: a new between-the-bread offering, and the sandwich's official name.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno, minced</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 can small red beans or pinto beans, preferably low sodium drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups no-salt-added tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon molasses</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
