    <h1>Marinated Chicken Breasts</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whether you need a quick BBQ chicken marinade recipe, a zingy lemon marinade or something a little different, there are plenty of recipes for inspiration.</p>
    <p>Chicken breasts are susceptible to drying out when overcooked, so they're best cooked quickly using high heat. That means skillet-cooking, stir-frying, roasting/baking, or grilling chicken breasts are the best routes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons vinegar, like cider, balsamic, or red wine</li>

        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons mustard, whole grain or Dijon</li>
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoon garlic or onion powder, optional</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the vinegar, herbs, mustard, powders if using and oil in a large re-sealable plastic bag. Close the bag and shake to combine all the ingredients. Open the bag, drop in the chicken breast in the bag. Close and shake the bag to coat evenly. Freeze for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        <li>Thaw in the refrigerator overnight, under cold, running water, or in the microwave at 30 percent power for 1 minute at a time.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill or grill pan. When the grill is hot, place the chicken on the grill and cook for about 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through. You can also bake the thawed chicken in a 375 degree F oven for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
